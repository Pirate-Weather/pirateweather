# Roadmap
1. Finish the API documentation.
2. Translations
	* Based on the [existing repository](https://github.com/alexander0042/translations).
3. Weather maps from new Zarr datafiles.
4. Text summaries.
	* Based on the [existing repository](https://github.com/alexander0042/translations).
 	* Or possibly AI if it's fast enough! 
5. Add in alerts for Canada/ EU/ other.
6. Add in fire index data for areas outside of the US and parts of Canada. This was suggested in [#119](https://github.com/Pirate-Weather/pirateweather/issues/119)
	* This would use the Canadian models (RDPS, GDPS) to achieve this
7. Add in an Air Quality Index. This is a suggestion in [issue #92](https://github.com/Pirate-Weather/pirateweather/issues/92)
8. Investigate using radar data/station data.
    *  Investigate if it's feasible to use radar data and/or station data for the currently conditions. This is a suggestion in [issue #10](https://github.com/alexander0042/pirateweather/issues/10).
9. Improve source data.
	* Add in the Canadian models (RDPS, GDPS)
	* Add in the [Real-Time Mesoscale Analysis model](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/rtma/) on a rapid (15 minute) update cycle for better current conditions. This is from the suggestion in [issue #30](https://github.com/alexander0042/pirate-weather-ha/issues/30).
