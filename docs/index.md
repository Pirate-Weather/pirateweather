# Introduction 
Weather forecasts are primarily found using models run by government agencies, but the [outputs](https://weather.gc.ca/grib/what_is_GRIB_e.html) aren't easy to use or in formats built for the web.
To try to address this, I've put together a service that reads weather forecasts and serves it following the [Dark Sky API](https://web.archive.org/web/20200723173936/https://darksky.net/dev/docs) style. 

Before going any farther, I wanted to add a [link to sign up and support this project](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/products/weather-data)! Running this on AWS means that it scales beautifully and is much more reliable than if I was trying to host this, but also costs real money. I'd love to keep this project going long-term, but I'm still paying back my student loans, which limits how much I can spend on this! Anything helps, and a $2 monthly donation lets me raise your API limit from 10,000 calls/ month to 20,000 calls per month.

Alternatively, I also have a GitHub Sponsorship page set up on my [profile](https://github.com/sponsors/alexander0042/)! This gives the option to make a one-time donation to contribute this project. This project (especially the free tier) wouldn't be possible without the ongoing support from the project sponsors, so they're the [heros here](https://github.com/sponsors/alexander0042/)!

## Recent Updates- Winter 2024
Up to version 2.5! As always, details are available in the [changelog](https://pirateweather.net/en/latest/changelog/).

* Added support for the Dark Sky translation module as per [issue #152](https://github.com/Pirate-Weather/pirateweather/issues/152).
* Correct 10:1 liquid snow ratio in intensity
* Zero intensity when pop==0 (https://github.com/Pirate-Weather/pirate-weather-code/issues/30)

## Background
This project started from two points: as part of my [PhD](https://coastlines.engineering.queensu.ca/dunexrt), I had to become very familiar with working with NOAA forecast results (<https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4725-3251>). Separately, an old tablet set up as a "Magic Mirror,” and was using a [weather module](https://github.com/jclarke0000/MMM-DarkSkyForecast) that relied on the Dark Sky API, as well as my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) setup. So when I heard that it was [shutting down](https://blog.darksky.net/dark-sky-has-a-new-home/), I thought, "I wonder if I could do this.” Plus, I love learning new things (<http://alexanderrey.ca/>), and I had been looking for a project to learn Python on, so this seemed like the perfect opportunity!
Spoiler alert, but it was way more difficult than I thought, but learned a lot throughout the process, and I think the end result turned out really well! 

## Why?
This API is designed to be a drop in replacement/ alternative to the Dark Sky API, and as a tool for assessing GFS, HRRR and NBM forecasts via a JSON API. This solves two goals:

1. It will also allow **legacy** applications to continue running after the Dark Sky shutdown, since as Home Assistant Integrations, Magic Mirror cards, and a whole host of other applications that have been developed over the years.
2. For anyone that is interested in knowing **exactly** how your weather forecasts are generated, this is the "show me the numbers" approach, since the data returned is directly from NOAA models, and every processing step I do is [documented](https://blog.pirateweather.net/). There are [lots](https://openweathermap.org/) [of](https://www.theweathernetwork.com) [existing](https://weather.com) [services](https://www.accuweather.com/) that provide custom forecasts using their own unique technologies, which can definitely improve accuracy, but I'm an engineer, so I wanted to be able to know what's going into the forecasts I'm using. If you're the sort of person who wants a [dense 34-page PowerPoint](http://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/pdf/Alexander_AMS_NWP_2020.pdf) about why it rained when the forecast said it wouldn't, then this might be for you.
3. I wanted to provide a more **community focused** source of weather data. Weather is local, but I'm only in one spot, so I rely on people filing [issues](https://github.com/alexander0042/pirateweather/issues) to help improve the forecast!
